          <h2 class="text-muted mt-5">What is ProductDiv?</h2>
          <p>
            ProductDiv is a web page editor that works anywhere! It accomplishes
            this by being and HTML and CSS first editor, running entirely client
            side and based on configuration. It was born out of a frustration
            with other visual editing tools either for a lack of
            configurability, extensability, or means of distribution. The core
            of ProductDiv is an open source library found
            <a href="https://github.com/awestbro/productdiv">here</a>. This
            project pulls it in as a dependency (in <code>package.json</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is
            configured to work with the
            <a
              href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/"
              >Bootstrap 5 CSS framework</a
            >. It provides utility classes and templates that work with
            Bootstrap and the theme generated in this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            ProductDiv the library works by rendering your templates in the page
            itself! This way as your project grows, evolves, and changes so do
            your templates! Since ProductDiv is configuration based, it is
            intended to live beside your project as a tool for all the
            developers on your team! Have a common component? Make a template
            defintion and your team never has to write that code again!
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-muted mt-5">How do I use ProductDiv?</h2>
          <p>
            Start using ProductDiv by clicking the purple "PD" button in the
            bottom left hand of your browser! This opens ProductDiv by wrapping
            the current page in an <code>iframe</code> element so it can render
            the ProductDiv editor! Now you should see ProductDiv on the left
            hand side of the screen ready for use! If you see elements being
            highlighted while you mouse over them don't panic! We'll get to that
            in just a moment.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-muted mt-5">Using the Template Selector</h3>
          <p>
            The Template selector should now be visible with all of your
            templates! Try hover over the "eye" icon to see a template rendered
            in your page! To put it into your page, click and drag any template
            item over your page. When dragging a template onto the page, you'll
            notice ProductDiv renders large rectangles around every element on
            your page. This is to ensure your template can be placed anywhere on
            the page because by default, there are many hidden elements that
            could normally not be selected by hovering over them. When trying to
            place an element, the outer top and left corners around an element
            are drop zones for prepending an element. Dropping a template over
            the bottom and right edges of an element will append the template
            after that element. If you drag a template over the element, you
            will see green highlighted boxes on the left and right halves of the
            element. This will do an inner prepend/ append. Once you know where
            you're placing your element, just release the drag and watch it pop
            into the page!
          </p>
          <p>
            Templates are defined in the
            <code>templates</code> section of your configuration for you to create,
            modify, and extend to your liking! Some templates even include
            containers to place other elements in them. Many of the "Layout"
            components make use of this feature to make empty cards, containers,
            rows, etc for you to drag elements in as you see fit! These become
            the building blocks of your application. To make your own container,
            in any template add:
            <code>
              &lt;div class="productdiv-drop-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code
            >. Try adding your own styles if you want to modify the
            preview!
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-muted mt-5">Editing Elements</h3>
          <p>
            The Element Editor is opened by either clicking an element you want
            to modify, or by dragging a template onto the page! Once it's open,
            you can modify the HTML directly if you so choose, or apply utility
            classes to the element using any of the defined classes! After
            scrolling down, you can see active classes on the element, matched
            classes based on configuration (i.e. if you click on an anchor, it
            will show link and button helpers since they can be directly applied
            to the element), and filtered classes if you so choose. Each utility
            class is defined with "Tags" that can be easily filtered using the
            "Filter by tag" and "Filter by name" inputs at the top of the
            section. For instance if I wanted to modify an element's margin and
            padding, I would select the "Spacing" tag from the tag filter and
            make sure my element is placed exactly where I want it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Attribute Editor can be used by clicking the "Attributes" button
            at the top of the Element Editor. This is used to modify any
            attributes on the element, such as style and others. Attributes can
            be added by clicking the "+" symbol next to the title.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much of the functionality of the Element Editor is in the actions.
            Under the HTML editor, you will see all of the actions available. An
            important one is Select Parent. This selects the immediate parent
            for this element and is useful for quickly navigating to elements
            that may be hard to click exactly. If you need to get to a hard to
            select parent element, just click its nearest child and "Select
            Parent" until you're on the node you want to select. Other useful
            editing actions are "Duplicate" and "Delete" which are
            self-explanatory. The "Move" action lets you drag and drop the
            element around the page like you are used to with the Template
            Selector! The "Copy HTML" action copies the HTML of the element to
            your clipboard. The "Copy As Template" button copies a javascript
            template version of your component so you can easily add it to your
            configuration and use the element from the Template Selector!
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-muted mt-5">Editor Actions</h3>

          <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Usage with client side frameworks</h4>
            <p>
              If you use a client-side rendering framework like React or Vue,
              your page changes will be lost when you turn off ProductDiv as the
              page performs a full document re-render. Please copy any changes
              you would like to keep to you code before toggling this off.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              If you're using static or server-side HTML, you can toggle
              ProductDiv on and off at will.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            At the bottom of the ProductDiv editor, there's a small menu for
            toggling ProductDiv off.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the right-hand side of the menu you'll find actions. From here
            you can copy the entire page's HTML, you can open documentation, and
            you can toggle the Tree View! This will open a seperate menu on the
            right hand side of the screen to help you easily navigate the nested
            structure of the DOM. Clicking an element in the TreeView will open
            it in the Element Editor! If you don't want certain nodes showing up
            here (useful for hiding script tags, svgs, etc) you can add a
            querySelector for it in your ProductDiv's configuration key for
            <code>treeViewIgnoreQuerySelectors</code>
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-muted mt-5">Making ProductDiv your own</h2>
          <p>
            ProductDiv is a foundation for your project that grows with you. All
            of it is entirely configurable so if you're adding new styles or
            components to your application, modify your ProductDiv configuration
            and you'll be set to develop with speed! Definitions for
            configuration are located in the ProductDiv main repository at:
            <a
              href="https://github.com/awestbro/productdiv/blob/main/app/utilities/configuration/configuration-importer.ts"
              >https://github.com/awestbro/productdiv/blob/main/app/utilities/configuration/configuration-importer.ts</a
            >.
            An example configuration could be defined as:
<pre>
    <code>
const configuration = {
    treeViewIgnoreQuerySelectors: [ 
        "script",
        "style",
        "link",
        '[data-productdiv="true"]',
        "svg",
    ],
    utilityClasses: [
        {
            name: "Margin Start",
            type: "selectMany",
            classes: [
                "ms-(0|1|2|3|4|5|auto)",
                `ms-(sm|md|lg|xl|xxl)-(0|1|2|3|4|5|auto)`,
            ],
            tags: ["Spacing", "Margin"],
            selectors: [".test"],
            documentationLink:
                "https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/#margin-and-padding",
        }
    ],
    templates: [
        {
            name: "Section Container",
            htmlTemplate: `
                    &lt;section&gt;
                        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
                          &lt;div class="productdiv-drop-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/section&gt;
                    `,
            tags: ["Layout"],
            previewWidth: string; // optional
        }
    ],
}        
    </code>
</pre>
          </p>

          <p>
              Above is a fully working configuration for ProductDiv. It's all templates and utility classes! Lets take a more in-depth look at the structure. Firstly <code>treeViewIgnoreQuerySelectors</code> will mostly be the same anywhere you use ProductDiv, but it can be used to exclude selectors of elements you don't want visible in the tree view (it can get very large with things like svgs). Under Utility classes is where things get interesting. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>utilityClasses</code> are defined by:
              <ul>
                  <li><code>name</code>: Their pretty name in the Element Editor</li>
                  <li><code>type</code>: The control to use when selecting. One of 'selectOne' or 'selectMany'</li>
                  <li><code>classes</code>: Any class that can be applied via this control
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        the <code>(option|option2)</code> syntax is expanded by ProductDiv, so for example <code>me-(1|2)</code> will become two options: <code>me-1</code> and <code>me-2</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                  <li><code>tags</code>: Tags help with searching, filtering, and categorizing in the filters section of the Element Editor</li>
                  <li><code>documentationLink</code>: This is a link to a URL for documentation</li>
                  <li><code>selectors</code>: A list of selectors this element will "match" when editing. This puts the control at the top of the list when editing making sure you always have the right editing controls in place for your element type.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>templates</code> are defined by:
              <ul>
                  <li><code>name</code>: Their pretty name in the Template Selector</li>
                  <li><code>htmlTemplate</code>: The HTML you want on your page</li>
                  <li><code>tags</code>: Tags help with searching, filtering, and categorizing in the filters section of the Template Selector</li>
                  <li><code>previewWidth</code>: an optional setting for displaying previews. Default template previews are set to 100% width</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
